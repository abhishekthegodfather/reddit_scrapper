0,AITA for pretending not to know my sister in a class that we’re both in?,"YTA. ""I’m not lying when I say this: we haven’t spoken a word to each other since that day. At first it started with my sister ignoring me,"" No, at first it started with you ignoring your sister. You don't get to put the blame on your sister for this petty fight and act as if you're shocked she started ignoring you after the way you treated her. You're honestly acting like an insecure loser, and your classmates will probably think so too when they find out the game you're playing. Treat your sister better. Oh and btw: ""then I cut her off and told her that I don’t help absolute randos in class"" Just so you know this statement makes you look like an even bigger AH. Most people in class are ""absolute randos"". So unless every single other person in that class is your friend (which I doubt), by saying you don't help ""randos"" shows you're not even a kind person to the majority of your classroom. Your classmates are going to think you're a dick if you keep up with this charade.",LurksAroundHere,1 day ago
1,"Kind of a dumb post, but do you ever just wanna play video games but once you have a chance to play you have zero motivation bc you’re just too tired mentally and physically lol","Used to work a pretty exhausting job. I loved it, but yeah when I'd get home I was too tired to really play anything. Probably what got me into watching all kinds of game reviews and stuff regularly now. I'd watch them until I'd finally fall asleep.",Inn0minus,2 days ago

4,What's something you have ZERO interest in?,"No matter who advertises it, no matter how good they say it is, I also have absolutely no interest in the game. There are very few mobile games I like and even then, I just don’t play them a whole lot.",Zackautocon72,23 hours ago
5,"A couple fed nearby ducks. Now, their HOA is threatening to foreclose.","Before getting out the pitchforks, here the side from someone who lives in her neighborhood: There is way, way more to this story. I live in the neighborhood. Pretty close to this lady actually. It’s a nightmare. They aren’t being sued for $250k. It’s a click bait, terrible headline. When filing a petition, lawyers are required state in all petitions what they are seeking monetary relief of $250k or less because that is what triggers the Discovery Plan Level. That’s all that number is, it is not the amount of damages being sought. The suit is not seeking any money other than attorneys fees. The relief sought is specifically outlined as, “Plaintiff request that the court award it a temporary and permanent injunction requiring Defendants to cease from feeding wildlife, including but not limited to ducks or other fowl, within the community.” They are also seeking to enforce the lien that every HOA has against a home and that the HOA may foreclose on the home if the Defendants don’t abide by the court’s injunction. This has been going on for years. The homeowners refused to address the issue. It’s not some overnight thing. I like how the article shows her with like 4 ducks. The problem is far more than 4 ducks. Try 50+ This shitshow (it is actually creating a LITERAL shitshow) caused by this lady has impacted the people that live around her. There’s duck crap everywhere. The ducks have destroyed neighbors yards and front porches. Some ducks have been killed due to the sheer amount that congregate in the road. People have been attacked by the ducks. Homeowners had tried to address this with her themselves and she’s not exactly been nice about it.",didimao0072000,8 days ago
6,I am an English teacher teaching a Video Game as Literature class this fall,"I just made this alt profile so I can network and talk with other gamers about the creation of my class. We’ll primarily be using game pass, because PS5 scarcity is still crazy, and we’ll have some Switches. I am still amazed my school district is allowing me to do this, and I’m so excited to be starting this journey proving more than Minecraft can be in the classroom! We’ll be playing a variety of games that are shorter, and some of the best levels of specific games. I’m playing as many games in gamepass as I can this summer to research writing activities and analysis of narrative plots to backup the creation of this class. I teach at a public school in the states, and got a grant for these consoles.",AnonymousCerealBowl,5 days ago

8,What’s a job that’s romanticized but in reality sucks?,"Game tester. I worked as a game tester for EA for almost 3 years. Here's what it's like. Imagine a game type you don't like. Maybe soccer games. Maybe an RTS. Whatever. You now play that game, 8 hours a day. But you don't play it. You test it. So let's imagine an RTS. You are told to test the resource acquisition systems. All you do is click around and make sure your guys can mine gold and harvest lumber. You click around the map and mine and forest. There is no combat, they've turned that off for your testing. There is no story, because you just flick from level to level to test the resource system. You test using one guy. You testing using 100 guys. You make sure no other units can gather resources. You try blocking your own guys. You try killing your own guys. 8 hours a day. Every day. For weeks.",shaidyn,10 days ago

11,"Eli5: What determines if a nationality ends with -ese (chinese, japanese...), -an (Ghanian, Egyptian, American) or just the county itself (Thai)?","What you're describing are exonyms—i.e., the name given to a country or people by foreign speakers. Common suffixes used in English exonyms, which all have the same basic meaning of ""of or related to,"" are: -ish (from the old Germanic -iskaz, like German -isch) -ese (from the Latin -ensis, like French -aise) -ic (from the Latin -icus, like Spanish -igo) -an (from the Latin -anus/-ana, like Italian -ano/-ana) -i (from the Arabic -iyy) You'd think there'd be a consistent pattern, like ""if an exonym ends in -ish, it's root is a German word, and if it ends in -ese, its root is a Latin word,"" right? Wrong. It wouldn't be English if it weren't confusing and didn't have more exceptions than rules. For instance, although Spain has roots in a Latin word (Hispania), its exonym is ""Spanish."" As for the origins of the exonyms themselves, they can also vary wildly. Some borrow the local endonyms (i.e., how the people refer to themselves), others are from prominent landmarks or geology, and some are the results of a millennia-long game of telephone. Here are some of the more interesting ones:",AdmiralAkbar1,5 days ago

16,LeBron James on The Shop: Celtics fans are “racist as f—k”,"Literally in the parking lot. There are several more, including stuff that’s happened right inside NBA arenas. But the incident that has stuck with me the most, and that’s had the biggest impact on me, occurred a few years back after a victory at the Garden. I was pulling out of the arena parking lot when I saw a white woman with her five- or six-year-old son crossing against the light right as the cars were starting to come at them. I had my windows down and realized something bad was about to happen, so I yelled to her, politely, that she needed to hurry and get out of the street so the two of them wouldn’t get hurt. The woman was wearing an Isaiah Thomas number 4 Celts jersey. And there were all these other Celtics fans around who were at the game. I figured she’d be cool. Nope. She swung her head around and it was…. “F*** you, you f***ing n-word!!!!” For a second it was like I couldn’t breathe. Did she really say that? And in an instant, just like that, I was made to feel less than human.",HokageEzio,3 days ago
